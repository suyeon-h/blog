##### _'So you want to be a writer?_' 

---------

if it doesn't come bursting out of you in spite of everything,   

don't do it.   

unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut,   

don't do it.   

if you have to sit for hours staring at your computer screen or hunched over    

your typewriter searching for words,   

don't do it.    

if you're doing it for money or fame,   

don't do it.   

if you're doing it because you want women in your bed,   

don't do it.   

if you have to sit there and rewrite it again and again,   

don't do it.   

if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,   

don't do it.   

if you're trying to write like somebody else,   

forget about it.   

if you have to wait for it to roar out of you,    

then wait patiently.   

if it never does roar out of you,   

do something else.

if you first have to read it to your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend   

or your parents or to anybody at all,   

you're not ready.   

.   

.   

.   

when it is truly time,   

and if you have been chosen,   

it will do it by   

itself and it will keep on doing it   

until you die or it dies in you.   

there is no other way.   

and there never was.
